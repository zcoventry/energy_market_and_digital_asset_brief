## HEADLINE
### DECENTRALIZED FINANCE IS RESHAPING OUR FINANCIAL REALITY
One of life's ironies is the changes that matter most are often easy to miss. 
> Our children are born and we are the center of our their world. We blink. Suddenly they are striding toward adulthood.
>
> We make healthy lifestyle decisions until they become habits. We blink. Those habits have transformed our physical, mental, and emotional realities.
> 
> We hone our profession for days and weeks and years. We blink. Those workdays have evolved into an impressive career.

Fundamental changes in the world of finance may be escaping our notice and, in parallel, reshaping our financial operating envir


I speculate that the same sort of changes are happening before our eyes in the world of finance. 

**Is it possible that blockchain technology, decentralized finance, and computational power are fundamentally reshaping our financial reality and, yet, those changes go largely unnoticed in the midst of our busy lives?** I think so.

How much of your banking is done on an app and not in a brick and mortar bank? Five years ago most people had never heard of bitcoin and now it can be purchased at the ATM on the corner and on the Cash App.

As a US$40 billion case-in-point, consider consider _Block, Inc._ Formerly _Square, Inc._, Block, Inc. is a publically traded financial technology company ([NYSE: SQ](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SQ:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwikkKC2qPCIAxW9GtAFHcMxOZsQ3ecFegQINRAZ) with a market capitalization approaching US$40 billion and 2023 revenues of almost US$22 billion. Block employs over 12,000 people across multiple businesses including Square; Cash App; TBD; Tidal; and Spiral. Chances are you've used Square and/or Cash App to pay for coffee, street food, or a haircut. 

> _Bitcoin is the best money. It whould be used like it. We build and fund free, open-source projects aimed at making bitcoin the planet's preferred currency_ [(Spiral (a Block, Inc. company))](https://spiral.xyz/).  
>
> _TBD is focused on building open and decentralized technologies to create a truly open financial world. Guided by this vision, TBD is creating an open source developer platform and infrastructure that enables everyone to access and participate in the global economy_ [(tbd (a Block, Inc. company))](https://tbd.website/).  

**Here's the punchline: Block and other financial innovatars are investing heavily in the culture and technology around decentralized finance. We may not feel the gravity of these changes in the moment, but their long-term implications are vast.** 


## ENERGY MARKETS  
**From most perspectives, U.S. energy market prices are a bargain right now though beginning to show bullish sentiments.** I do not expect these buying opportunities to persist in the medium term. 

### POWER MARKETS  

ERCOT and PJM wholesale power prices are clearing around $25/MWh (Figure 1) and $30/MWh (Figure 2), respectively.

These prices fall in the bottom half of a twenty-four month price range for both ERCOT  (Figure 3) and PJM (Figure 4).

### NATURAL GAS MARKETS  
Annualized natural gas prices remain at near-historic lows (Figure 5). These low prices will be challenged by multiple bullish forces such as increasing LNG exports and U.S. storage values creeping closer to the five-year historical average (Figure 6).

### WEATHER  
Near-term temperatures are looking bullish for ERCOT and slighlty bullish for PJM (Figures X and X). NOAA is also predicting above average fall and early-winter temperatures for these markets. Above average temperatures during these time periods typically exert downward pressure on domestic enertgy prices due to decreased heating demand.
