## ENERGY MARKETS  
**U.S. energy market prices are a bargain right now, though beginning to show bullish sentiments.** I do not expect these buying opportunities to persist in the medium term. 

### POWER MARKETS  
ERCOT and PJM average monthly wholesale power prices are clearing around $25/MWh (Figure 3) and $35/MWh (Figure 4), respectively. These prices fall in the lower half of a twelve-month historical range (Figures 5 and 6).

### NATURAL GAS MARKETS  
Annualized natural gas prices remain at near-historic lows (Figure 7), however spot prices have risen by about $0.03/MMBtu over the last week. I am still bullish in the medium-term due to increasing demand for grid power (e.g., data center loads), increasing LNG export capabilities, and U.S. natural storage values falling closer to the five-year historical average (Figure 8).

### WEATHER 
Near-term weather outlooks are bearish for ERCOT, PJM, and the U.S. natural gas market. Warmer temperatures will delay heating demands in the northeast and cooling loads in the south will be moderate (Figures 9 and 10). 

Fall and winter temperatures are forecasted to be slightly above average (Figure 11). If these forecasted temperatures become a reality, they will have a bearish influence on U.S. power and gas markets.
