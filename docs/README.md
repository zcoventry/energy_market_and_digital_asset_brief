Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are all pursuing nuclear options to power their data centers.

## ENERGY MARKETS  
**From most perspectives, U.S. energy market prices are a bargain right now though beginning to show bullish sentiments.** I do not expect these buying opportunities to persist in the medium term. 

### POWER MARKETS  
ERCOT and PJM wholesale power prices are clearing around $25/MWh (Figure 1) and $30/MWh (Figure 2), respectively. When evaluated agains prices ranges over the last twenty-four months, these prices fall in the bottom half of the range for ERCOT (Figure 3) and PJM (Figure 4).

### NATURAL GAS MARKETS  
Annualized natural gas prices remain at near-historic lows (Figure 5). These low prices will be challenged by multiple bullish forces such as increasing LNG exports and U.S. storage values creeping closer to the five-year historical average (Figure 6).

### WEATHER 
For ERCOT, near-term temparature outlooks (Figures 7 and 8) are slightly bullish since above average fall temperatures prolong cooling loads and reduce the amount of natural gas available for storage. For PJM, these same outlooks are mostly neutral since temperatures are not yet low enough to generate significant heating loads.

NOAA is predicting above average fall and early-winter temperatures which should be bearish for in both ERCOT and PJM (Figure 9). From a supply/demand balance perspective, a major cold weather event in the early fall could cause a price spike due to the tightness of the supply/demand balance in U.S.markets.
