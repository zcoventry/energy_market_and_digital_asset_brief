## HEADLINE
### 1

## ENERGY MARKETS  
**U.S. energy market prices are a bargain right now from most perspectives.** I do not expect these buying opportunities to persist in the medium term. 

### POWER MARKETS  

ERCOT and PJM wholesale power prices are clearing around $25/MWh (Figure X) and $30/MWh (Figure X), respectively. From an annualized perspective, these prices fall in the bottom half of a twenty-four month price range (Figures X and X, respectively).

### NATURAL GAS MARKETS  
Annualized natural gas prices remain at near-historic lows (Figure X). These low prices will be challenged by multiple bullish forces such as increasing LNG exports and U.S. storage values creeping closer to the five-year historical average (Figure X).

### WEATHER  
Near-term temperatures are looking bullish for ERCOT and slighlty bullish for PJM (Figures X and X). NOAA is also predicting above average fall and early-winter temperatures for these markets. Above average temperatures during these time periods typically exert downward pressure on domestic enertgy prices due to decreased heating demand.
